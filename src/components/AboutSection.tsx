            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              My passion for game development began in high school when I created my first simple snake game with Python. 
              Since then, I've evolved into a well-rounded developer with experience across multiple engines, 
              programming languages, and game genres.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Throughout my academic journey, I've focused on both the technical and creative aspects of game 
              development, from low-level engine programming to high-level game design and user experience.
